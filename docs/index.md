# gRPC Provider

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) provider is used to make stateless gRPC requests.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    grpc = {
      source = "ryanwholey/grpc"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: This provider is experimental and subject to change. PRs welcome!
